The player will use the arrow keys to navigate the twists and turns. The player wins when they exit the maze.\r\n</p><br>\r\n<p>\r\nThe GUI will show 9-tiles with the player's character at the center tile. The outer 8 tiles represent the surroundings of the player. As the player navigates through the maze, the GUI will show the tiles changing.\r\n</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>\r\nFEATURES:\r\n</h2>\r\n-Exit the maze.\r\n<br>\r\n-Use the arrow keys to navigate.\r\n<br>\r\n-9-tile GUI display.\r\n<br>\r\n-Restart the game after winning.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2>\r\nCLASS SUMMARY:\r\n</h2>\r\n<h3>\r\nLogic\r\n</h3>\r\n-Accepts a move if valid and commits it into the game.\r\n<br>\r\n-Calls a GameEvent when the game has been won.\r\n<br>\r\n-Calls a GameEvent when the player has moved.\r\n<br>\r\n-Places the character into the starting position at the beginning of the game.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nMaze\r\n</h3>\r\n-Gets a list of possible moves.\r\n<br>\r\n-Information is stored as a 2D Wall array.\r\n<br>\r\n-Loads a maze from a file.\r\n<br>\r\n-Checks if a coordinate is within the bounds of the maze.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nCharacter\r\n</h3>\r\n-Contains the current position in the maze.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nTileArtist\r\n</h3>\r\n-Draws/updates the map tiles on the GUI.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nUI\r\n</h3>\r\n-Receives key presses and submits them to the Logic.\r\n<br>\r\n-Shows the player.\r\n<br>\r\n-Shows the player's surroundings.\r\n<br>\r\n-Shows game stats i. e. scores and time limits.\r\n<br>\r\n-Shows the player when they win.\r\n<br>\r\n-Asks the player if they want to play again and, if so, starts the new game.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nMessenger\r\n</h3>\r\n-Notifies the UI the game is won.\r\n<br>\r\n-Notifies the UI the player has moved.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nWall\r\n</h3>\r\n-Holds information about which directions are blocked.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2>\r\nGAME SCENARIOS:\r\n</h2>\r\n<h4>\r\nPlayer Presses A Key\r\n</h4>\r\n-JFrame class calls event listener UI.keyReleased().\r\n<br>\r\n-keyReleased() calls Logic.makeMove().\r\n<br>\r\n-makeMove() checks maze.getWall().getDirections() to ensure move is valid.\r\n<br>\r\n-makeMove() checks maze.contains() to see if the move is inside the map.\r\n<br>\r\n-If not inside, the player has won the game and ui.playerWins() is called.\r\n<br>\r\n-If valid, Logic updates the character position with character.getCoordinate().translate().\r\n<br>\r\n-If valid, Logic calls UI.playerMoved() to tell it the view should be updated.\r\n<br>\r\n-If valid, UI calls TileArtist.repaint() for each tile.\r\n<br>\r\n-If valid, eventually repaint() will call paintComponent().\r\n<br>\r\n-If valid, paintComponent() updates the screen. \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nGame Starts Up\r\n</h3>\r\n-main creates/loads the maze.\r\n<br>\r\n-main creates a new character.\r\n<br>\r\n-main creates a new Logic class\r\n<br>\r\n-Logic constructor calls newMaze()\r\n<br>\r\n-newMaze() sets the starting position (could be random).\r\n<br>\r\n-main creates a new UI.\r\n<br>\r\n-main sets the event listener in Logic to the UI.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nPlayer wins\r\n</h3>\r\n-logic.makeMove() calls ui.playerWins()\r\n<br>\r\n-GUI shows the player won.\r\n<br>\r\n-GUI asks the player if they want to play again.\r\n<br>\r\n-GUI calls logic.newMaze() to restart the game.\r\n<br>\r\n","name":"Labyrinth"}
